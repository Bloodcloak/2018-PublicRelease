# 2018-PublicRelease
Our 2018 code that is documented featuring swerve drive control logic.

There is a known bug in the swerve module direction contol logic which may cause abrupt 180 pivots of modules. 
We decided not to persue a fix and believe it might be caused by sensor noise or anomolous data readings from encoders.

Note: Our Dashboard is undocumented but should be straightforward with basic Labview knowlege.
